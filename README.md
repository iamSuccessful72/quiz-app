#My Random Quiz App
My random quiz app, basically what is does is pick a set of questions at random with possibilities of repeated questions,
and the questions are displayed along with 4 options 3 incorrect answers and 1 correct answer when the player is done, the scores are calculated and the users
sees the one's they got correctly and the one's they failed too, i made it so the user has to click an option before moving to the next question.
